<p>
I am an engineer at heart and by training.
I love building stuff and doing research.
I am a Systems Engineer with expertise in both the front-end and back-end. I have a strong foundation in systems engineering and are proficient in technologies such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), GIT, and Python.

I am able to design and build scalable and reliable systems using a variety of tools and technologies. I am comfortable working with both front-end and back-end technologies, and have the ability to troubleshoot and debug complex issues.

I have strong technical skills and am able to handle a wide range of tasks and responsibilities in software development, including designing and building web applications, managing databases, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.
